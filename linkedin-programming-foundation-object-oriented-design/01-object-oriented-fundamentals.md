## Object-Oriented Thinking

There are different programming paradigms:

* Procedural Programming Languages
  * C
* Object Oriented Programming Languages
  * C#, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Swift, VB.NET and etc.
* Logic Programming Languages
  * Prolog
* Functional Programming Languages
  * Haskell

The object orientated programming is NOT a language itself, instead, object orientation is referred to as a **programming paradigm**.

### Procedural Programming Languages

* A program is written as a long series of operations to execute
* Can be organized into named functions or sub-routines to make the code modular and maintainable

Advantage of the procedural approach includes quick and easier way ot completing a tasks. However, it is not great for scalability and changes in the future.

### Object Oriented Programming Languages

* Code is split apart into several contained object instead of a single large program
* Each object contains its own data and logic to describe how it behaves and interacts with other objects

Although writing code in object oriented approach may feel bloated and way beyond the scope of a  project, advantage of includes **code reusability** where the real value of object orientation will appear as your projects grow in scale and require changes.
