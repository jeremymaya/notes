## Use Cases

Essential Use Cases Components:

* Title - What is the goal?
* Primary Actors - Who desires/interact with it?
* Success Scenario - How is it accomplished?

### Title

Keep the title short and simple - the title for a use case should be a __short phrase__ with an __active verb__ that describes a goal

### Actor

Actor vs. User - need to identify exactly who is having this interaction

An actor could be __any external entity__ that acts on the system including other computer systems.

### Success Scenario

Keep the success scenarios short and succinct, using everyday, non-technical language.

#### Use Case: Scenario as Paragraph

```text
Title: Heat Metal
Primary Actor: Astronaut
Success Scenario: Astronaut inserts meal package. System identifies type of meal. System heats package for length of time required for meal type. System notifies astronaut that meal is ready via space pager. Astronaut removes package from system. 
```

#### Use Case: Scenario as Steps with Extensions

```text
Success Scenario:

1. Astronaut inserts meal package
2. System identifies type of meal
3. System heats package for length time required for meal type
4. System notifies astronaut that meal is ready via space pager
5. Astronaut removes package from system

Extensions:

2a Describe steps for unidentified package
4a Describe steps for space-pager system error
```

Add extensions or steps for alternative flows, for what happens when things go wrong depending on the situation.
