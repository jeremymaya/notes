## Defining Requirements

Functional requirements describes required __features__ - "The system/application **must do...**".

Non-functional requirements describes required __characteristics__ - "The system/application **should be ...**"

It covers legal, performance, support, security, and etc with the "ilities" like:

* Reliabilities
* Maintainability
* Reliability
* Usability
* Availability

Focus on capturing the __absolute minimum__ set of requirements when defining requirements - the minimum viable product (MVP).

## FURPS Requirements

`FURPS` serves as a checklist of several key qualities to consider when determining requirements.

* **F**unctionality - Capability, Reusability, Security
* **U**sability - Human Factors, Aesthetics, Consistency, Documentation
* **R**eliability - Availability, Failure Rate & Duration, Predictability
* **P**erformance - Speed, Efficiency, Resource Consumption, Scalability
* **S**upportability - Testability, Extensibility, Serviceability, Configurability

There is an extension to the FURPS model called `FURPS+` which add four more categories.

* Design - addresses constraints on how the software must be built
* Implementation - does it have to be written in a certain language? Are there standards or methodologies that need to be followed?
* Interface - is there an external system that needs to be interfaced with?
* Physical - actual physical constraints related to the hardware the application will be deployed on

The purpose of FURPS+ is to prompt to think about certain key requirement areas. But not all of these will be relevant to every project.
