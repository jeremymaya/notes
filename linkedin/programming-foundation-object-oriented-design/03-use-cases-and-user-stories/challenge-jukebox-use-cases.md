* Success Scenario:
  1. System identifies user.
  2. User browses available albums and songs.
  3. User selects a song
  4. System begins playing selected song.
  5. User continues browsing and selects a second song.
  6. System adds second song to play queue.
  7. System plays second song after first song is over.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want my song to be added to the front of a long play queue, so that I don't have to wait hours to hear it.
* As a user, I want to be identified without touching anything, so that my hands are free to do other things.
* As a user, I want to sort and browse songs by artist, so that I can listen to every song by ABBA.
* As a commander, I want the ability to cancel other user selections, so that I don't have to listen to disco the whole way to the moon.
