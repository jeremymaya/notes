## Creating Safety and Inclusion

Creating a safe and inclusive environment is important. __Psychological safety__ creates a environment for teams to their best work.

Psychological Safety - a sense of confidence the team will not embarrass, reject, or punish someone for speaking up wih ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes

* Respecting and trusting people at work

## Facilitating Teams

Groups naturally moves through stages. A classic model is Bruce Tuckman's stages of group development:

1. Forming
2. Storming
3. Norming
4. Performing
5. Adjourning

What happens in the first two stages determines whether teams move toward positive, healthy interactions or devolve into dysfunctional behaviors.

Four Gates to Peak Team Performance

1. Safety - Physical Safety + Psychological Safety/Inclusion
2. Purpose - Purpose + Strengths > Sense of We
3. Belonging - Trust + Respect > Rhythm of Team + Collaboration
4. Peak Performing - Innovation + Transformation
