## Understanding Humans at Work

Think about colleagues and their top values.

EQ is more about effort than innate skill.

Human brains are wired for three core things:

1. We are wired to survive
2. We are wired to belong
3. We are wired to become our best self

## Extending Empathy

Empathy - awareness and connection to others' feelings, needs, and concerns

Let go of golden rule and instead of use the platinum rule:

* Golden rule - do unto other as you would have them unto you
* **Platinum rule** - do unto others as they would want to have unto them

Being a great leader is extending empathy to those above, beside, and below you.

Social awareness is about applying empathy to group settings.
